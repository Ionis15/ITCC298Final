<p> My name is Caleb Howard, I study at American Public University and work for the United States Coast Guard. Due to my Job, I often spend large portions of my time at sea away from any form of internet connection and means of acquiring new information for my classes. This tool was made with that in mind, it allows me to research and record bodies of information and memorize it later with variance and repetition, regardless of my location. </p>
